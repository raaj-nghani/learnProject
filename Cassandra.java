What is Apache Cassandra

This section is perhaps one that is very dear to me having had the opportunity to use the popular Apache Cassandra NoSQL database back in 2011 when it was freshly open-sourced by Facebook. It has been an amazing experience to see it evolve other the years, as well as working with its two commercial custom extensions, namely DataStax Enterprise (short for DSE) marketed by DataStax, and Stratio's Cassandra Lucene Index which is an open-sourced project from Stratio. For the purpose of illustration, we'll start off with the free open-sourced version of Cassandra, and then follow on with DSE. It goes without saying that DataStax has been a major contributor in pushing the platform further, and you will find a lot of useful documentation at DataStax. We will naturally demonstrate various ways of accessing Cassandra through Scala!
